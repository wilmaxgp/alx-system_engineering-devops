Explanation of Specifics about the Infrastructure:

**For every additional element, why you are adding it:**
   - Each additional element is added to enhance the scalability, reliability, and performance of the infrastructure as it grows. For example:
     - Adding a server allows for increased capacity to handle more traffic and workload.
     - Configuring a load balancer as a cluster ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing traffic across multiple servers.
     - Splitting components (web server, application server, database) onto separate servers improves isolation, resource allocation, and fault isolation, enabling better scalability and performance optimization for each component.

By adding these elements, the infrastructure becomes more resilient, scalable, and capable of handling increased traffic and workload demands.
