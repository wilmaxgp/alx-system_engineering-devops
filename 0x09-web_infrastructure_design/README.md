# Web Infrastructure Design

This is an ALX Student Software Engineering project focuses on designing and understanding various web infrastructures for hosting websites, ensuring redundancy, scalability, security, and monitoring.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple tasks, each task addressing specific requirements related to web infrastructure design. Below is an overview of the tasks:

1. **Simple Web Stack**:
   Design a one-server web infrastructure using a LAMP stack to host the website reachable via www.foobar.com.

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**:
   Design a three-server web infrastructure with load balancing and database clustering for www.foobar.com.

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**:
   Design a three-server web infrastructure with firewalls, SSL encryption, and monitoring for www.foobar.com.

4. **Scale Up**:
   Configure a load balancer cluster and split components onto separate servers for enhanced scalability.

## Requirements

Each task has specific requirements regarding the components to be used, the explanations required, and the issues to be addressed.
