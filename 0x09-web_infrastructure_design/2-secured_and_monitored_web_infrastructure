A - Explanation of Specifics about the Infrastructure:

1. **For every additional element, why you are adding it:**
   - Each additional element serves a specific purpose in enhancing the functionality, security, or performance of the infrastructure. For example, firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, SSL certificates are used to encrypt data transmitted between users and the website, and monitoring tools are employed to track the health and performance of the servers and services.

2. **What are firewalls for:**
   - Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules, helping to prevent unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and data breaches.

3. **Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:**
   - Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between users' web browsers and the web server. HTTPS encryption, facilitated by SSL certificates, protects sensitive information transmitted over the network from interception, eavesdropping, and tampering, safeguarding user privacy and data integrity.

4. **What monitoring is used for:**
   - Monitoring is used to track the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure and its components. It involves collecting and analyzing data related to server metrics, application performance, network traffic, and security events to identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure the reliability and security of the services provided.

5. **How the monitoring tool is collecting data:**
   - Monitoring tools collect data through various means, including agent-based monitoring agents installed on servers, network traffic analysis, log file parsing, and application instrumentation. These tools gather information on server resource utilization, application response times, error logs, and security events, providing insights into the overall health and performance of the infrastructure.

6. **Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:**
   - To monitor your web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), you can use monitoring tools that support performance metrics tracking. Configure the monitoring tool to collect data on incoming requests to the web server and calculate the QPS metric based on the number of requests received per second. Adjust monitoring settings as needed to capture relevant data and set up alerts to notify you of any fluctuations or anomalies in QPS.

B - Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:**
   - Terminating SSL at the load balancer level means that SSL decryption occurs at the load balancer before passing decrypted traffic to the backend servers. This can introduce security risks, as sensitive data is exposed within the internal network, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access or interception.

2. **Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:**
   - Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure. If the primary MySQL server fails, it can result in data loss or service downtime until the server is restored or failover mechanisms are activated. Additionally, it can limit scalability and performance, as a single server may not be able to handle high write loads efficiently.

3. **Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem:**
   - Having servers with identical components can lead to a lack of redundancy and increased vulnerability to failures. If all servers have the same components and one of them fails, it can impact the availability and performance of the entire infrastructure. Introducing diversity in server roles and configurations can help mitigate risks and enhance fault tolerance.
